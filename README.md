- You have 2 stacks named a and b.
- At the beginning:
- The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
- The stack b is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>sa (swap a)</td>
    <td>Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sb (swap b)</td>
    <td>Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ss</td>
    <td>sa and sb at the same time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pa (push a)</td>
    <td>Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pb (push b)</td>
    <td>Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ra (rotate a)</td>
    <td>Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rb (rotate b)</td>
    <td>Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rr</td>
    <td>ra and rb at the same time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rra (reverse rotate a)</td>
    <td>Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rrb (reverse rotate b)</td>
    <td>Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rrr</td>
    <td>rra and rrb at the same time.</td>
  </tr>
